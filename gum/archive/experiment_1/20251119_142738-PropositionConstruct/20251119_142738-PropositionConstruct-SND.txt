[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant tasked with analyzing user behavior based on transcribed activity.\n\n# Analysis\n\nUsing a transcription of andrew\'s activity, analyze andrew\'s current activities, behavior, and preferences. Draw insightful, concrete conclusions.\n\nTo support effective information retrieval (e.g., using BM25), your analysis must **explicitly identify and refer to specific named entities** mentioned in the transcript. This includes applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, and any other proper nouns. Avoid general summaries—**use exact names** wherever possible, even if only briefly referenced.\n\nConsider these points in your analysis:\n\n- What specific tasks or goals is andrew actively working towards, as evidenced by named files, apps, platforms, or individuals?\n- What applications, documents, or content does andrew clearly prefer engaging with? Identify them by name.\n- What does andrew choose to ignore or deprioritize, and what might this imply about their focus or intentions?\n- What are the strengths or weaknesses in andrew’s behavior or tools? Cite relevant named entities or resources.\n\nProvide detailed, concrete explanations for each inference. **Support every claim with specific references to named entities in the transcript.**\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you generate, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence based on how clearly the evidence supports your claim. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is there direct interaction with a specific, named entity (e.g., opened “Notion,” responded to “Slack” from “Alex”)?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence clearly tied to the proposition?\n- **Engagement Level**: Was the interaction meaningful or sustained?\n\nScore: **1 (weak support)** to **10 (explicit, strong support)**. High scores require specific named references.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the proposition is likely to stay relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Urgency**: Does the task or interest have clear time pressure?\n- **Durability**: Will this matter 24 hours later or more?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-lasting insight or pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nBelow is a set of transcribed actions and interactions that andrew has performed:\n\n## User Activity Transcriptions\n\n[Manual] ```markdown\n## Building the Website for My Course (Coding Timelapse)\n\n### File Explorer\n- `index.html`\n- `alternatingBlocks.scss`\n- `decorations.scss`\n\n### Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)\n```\n<!-- index.html -->\n<section class="fullwidthFeature">\n</section>\n\n<section class="alternatingBlocks">\n</section>\n\n<section class="quote">\n    <div class="container">\n        <!-- Content -->\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<main>\n</main>\n\n<footer>\n</footer>\n\n<!-- colors.scss -->\n@use \'functions\' as *;\n\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n\n<!-- spacing.scss -->\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n\n<!-- font-size.scss -->\n$font-size-xsm: 1rem;\n$font-size-sm: 1.125rem;\n$font-size-md: 1.25rem;\n$font-size-lg: 1.5rem;\n$font-size-xl: 2rem;\n\n<!-- flex.scss -->\n$flex-direction: row;\n$justify-content: center;\n$align-items: center;\n```\n\n### Terminal\n```\nDEBUG CONSOLE\nTERMINAL\n1: pwsh\n```\n\n### Browser Console\n```\nTask after 30 ms\nbrowserSyncReload...\nbrowserSyncReload after 1.04 ms\n```\n\n### Webpage Design\n- **Protected Payments**\n  - **Praesent a justo efficitur, tincidunt purus quis**\n  - Ut sapien lectus, vulputate vitae lacus vel, tincidunt sodales ipsum.

The code includes sections for a full-width feature, alternating blocks, and a quote section.\n- **Terminal**: The terminal at the bottom shows a command being executed: `pwsh`, which likely stands for PowerShell. The output indicates a task is scheduled to run after 30 ms, followed by a browser sync reload.\n- **Code Snippet**: The user appears to be adding or editing the HTML markup, as indicated by the text "Adding the HTML markup" in the video player controls.\n\n#### Image 2:\n- **Code Editor**: The user continues to work on the HTML file (`index.html`), focusing on the quote section. The code snippet shows the closing tag of the `<main>` element and the opening tag of the `<footer>` element.\n- **Design Preview**: On the right side, there is a design preview of the website. The preview shows a section with a blue background and a quote from Janice Hsu, Founder and CEO of Evermindly. The design includes responsive elements, as shown by the tablet and smartphone views.\n- **Code Snippets**: Below the design preview, there are snippets of CSS files (`colors.scss`, `spacing.scss`, etc.), indicating that the user is also working on styling aspects of the website.\n\n#### Image 3:\n- **Code Editor**: The user is still in the code editor, focusing on the `index.html` file. The code snippet shows the closing tag of the `<main>` element and the opening tag of the `<footer>` element.\n- **Design Preview**: The design preview remains consistent with the previous image, showing the same section with the blue background and the quote from Janice Hsu.\n- **Code Snippets**: The user is still working on the CSS files, particularly on the `colors.scss` file, where color variables are defined using `rem` units for spacing.\n\n### Summary of Actions:\n- The user is building a responsive website for a course.\n- They are currently focused on adding and editing HTML markup in the `index.html` file.\n- The user is also working on styling the website using SCSS (Sass) files, defining colors and spacing.\n- The design preview shows a section with a quote, indicating progress in creating a visually appealing and responsive layout.\n- The terminal output suggests that the user is testing or running commands related to the development process, possibly involving browser synchronization and task scheduling.\n\n# Task\n\nGenerate **at least 5 distinct, well-supported propositions** about andrew, each grounded in the transcript. \n\nBe conservative in your confidence estimates. Just because an application appears on andrew\'s screen does not mean they have deeply engaged with it. They may have only glanced at it for a second, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. \n\nAssign high confidence scores (e.g., 8-10) only when the transcriptions provide explicit, direct evidence that andrew is actively engaging with the content in a meaningful way. Keep in mind that that the content on the screen is what the user is viewing. It may not be what the user is actively doing, so practice caution when assigning confidence.\n\nGenerate propositions across the scale to get a wide range of inferences about andrew.  \n\nReturn your results in this exact JSON format:\n\n{\n  "propositions": [\n    {\n      "proposition": "[Insert your proposition here]",\n      "reasoning": "[Provide detailed evidence from specific parts of the transcriptions to clearly justify this proposition. Refer explicitly to named entities where applicable.]",\n      "confidence": "[Confidence score (1–10)]",\n      "decay": "[Decay score (1–10)]"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}'}]
