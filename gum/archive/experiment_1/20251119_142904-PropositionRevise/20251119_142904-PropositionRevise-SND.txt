[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are an expert analyst. A cluster of similar propositions are shown below, followed by their supporting observations.\n\nYour job is to produce a **final set** of propositions that is clear, non-redundant, and captures everything about the user, {user_name}.\n\nTo support information retrieval (e.g., with BM25), you must **explicitly identify and preserve all named entities** from the input wherever possible. These may include applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, or any other specific proper nouns mentioned in the original propositions or their evidence.\n\nYou MAY:\n\n- **Edit** a proposition for clarity, precision, or brevity.\n- **Merge** propositions that convey the same meaning.\n- **Split** a proposition that contains multiple distinct claims.\n- **Add** a new proposition if a distinct idea is implied by the evidence but not yet stated.\n- **Remove** propositions that become redundant after merging or splitting.\n\nYou should **liberally add new propositions** when useful to express distinct ideas that are otherwise implicit or entangled in broader statements—but never preserve duplicates.\n\nWhen editing, **retain or introduce references to specific named entities** from the evidence wherever possible, as this improves clarity and retrieval fidelity.\n\nEdge cases to handle:\n\n- **Contradictions** – If two propositions conflict, keep the one with stronger supporting evidence, or merge them into a conditional statement. Lower the confidence score of weaker or uncertain claims.\n- **No supporting observations** – Keep the proposition, but retain its original confidence and decay unless justified by new evidence.\n- **Granularity mismatch** – If one proposition subsumes others, prefer the version that avoids redundancy while preserving all distinct ideas.\n- **Confidence and decay recalibration** – After editing, merging, or splitting, update the confidence and decay scores based on the final form of the proposition and evidence.\n\nGeneral guidelines:\n\n- Keep each proposition clear and concise (typically 1–2 sentences).\n- Maintain all meaningful content from the originals.\n- Provide a brief reasoning/evidence statement for each final proposition.\n- Confidence and decay scores range from 1–10 (higher = stronger or longer-lasting).\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you revise, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence in the proposition based on how directly and clearly it is supported by the evidence. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is the claim directly supported by clear, named interactions in the observations?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence closely tied to the proposition?\n- **Completeness**: Are key details present and unambiguous?\n- **Engagement Level**: Does the user interact meaningfully with the named content?\n\nScore: **1 (weak/assumed)** to **10 (explicitly demonstrated)**. High scores require direct and strong evidence from the observations.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the insight is likely to remain relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Immediacy**: Is the activity time-sensitive?\n- **Durability**: Will the proposition remain true over time?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-term relevance or behavioral pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nProposition 1: Andrew is actively working on styling the website using SCSS files.\nReasoning: The user is actively working on SCSS files such as `colors.scss`, `spacing.scss`, and `font-size.scss`, which contain CSS variables and styles.\nProposition 2: Andrew prefers to develop projects with responsive design principles.\nReasoning: The user is working on a project involving responsive design, as indicated by the use of `rem()` functions in the SCSS files.\nProposition 3: Andrew prefers to see the real-time preview of his website while developing.\nReasoning: The user is using a browser to view the live preview of the website, indicating a preference for real-time feedback on their work.\nProposition 4: Andrew uses the terminal to manage tasks and automate processes during development.\nReasoning: The user is executing commands in the terminal, which implies they are managing tasks such as reloading the browser or running other development-related commands.\nProposition 5: Andrew is currently engaged in front-end web development using Visual Studio Code.\nReasoning: The user is working within Visual Studio Code, specifically editing SCSS files, which indicates a focus on front-end development.\nProposition 6: Andrew is focused on refining the design of angled top and bottom elements in his project.\nReasoning: The user is frequently interacting with the `decoration.scss` file, modifying SCSS styles for angled top and bottom elements, indicating a deep engagement with the project\'s design aspects.\nProposition 7: Andrew is currently focused on styling a `.quote` class in his SCSS file (`quote.scss`).\nReasoning: The user is actively working on a SCSS file (`quote.scss`) and adding styles for a `.quote` class, which involves setting background color, text color, and font size. The presence of specific SCSS code snippets and the user\'s focus on the file suggest a deep engagement with the styling process.\nProposition 8: Andrew is working on a multi-file project related to a responsive web design course.\nReasoning: The user has opened multiple files in Visual Studio Code, including `index.html` and various SCSS files, indicating that they are working on a multi-file project. The presence of a responsive web design course title suggests that Andrew is building a website.\nProposition 9: Andrew prefers to test his changes immediately using `browserSyncReload`.\nReasoning: The terminal output shows successful execution of tasks like `jsTask` and `browserSyncReload`, indicating that Andrew is testing his changes in real-time. This suggests a preference for immediate feedback during development.\nProposition 10: Andrew has a preference for SCSS but is not currently actively working on the `colors.scss` file.\nReasoning: The user has opened a SCSS file (`colors.scss`) but did not make any visible changes in the provided transcriptions. This implies that while Andrew might have a preference for SCSS, he is currently not actively working on this particular file.\nProposition 11: Andrew values responsive design principles in his web development projects.\nReasoning: The user is working on a responsive web design project, as indicated by the course title and the use of CSS media queries in the SCSS file. This suggests that Andrew values responsive design principles.\n\nSupporting observations:\n- ```markdown\n# Visual Studio Code Screenshot Transcription\n\n## File Explorer\n- `index.html`\n- `quote.scss`\n- `decorations.scss`\n- `hero.scss`\n\n## Decorations.scss File Content\n```scss\n@use \'../util\' as *;\n\n* > .angled-top, * > .angled-bottom {\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n* > .angled-top, * > .angled-bottom {\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n.angled-top::before, .angled-bottom::after {\n    content: \'\';\n    position: absolute;\n    background: $darkPurple;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\n.angled-top {\n    &::before {\n        top: 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Colors.scss File Content\n```scss\n@use \'functions\' as *;\n\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n```\n\n## Terminal Output\n```\nTask \'after 22 ms\nbrowserSyncReload\'...\nbrowserSyncReload\' after 492 µs\nBrowsers...\n```\n\n## Web Browser\n- `localhost:3000`\n- `Mythos`\n\n## Website Content\n- **PROTECTED PAYMENTS**\n  - **Praesent a justo efficitur, tincidunt purus quis**\n  - Ut sapien lectus, vulputate vitae lacus vel, tincidunt sodales ipsum.
