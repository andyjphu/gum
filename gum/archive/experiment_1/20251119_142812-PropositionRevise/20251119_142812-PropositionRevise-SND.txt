[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are an expert analyst. A cluster of similar propositions are shown below, followed by their supporting observations.\n\nYour job is to produce a **final set** of propositions that is clear, non-redundant, and captures everything about the user, {user_name}.\n\nTo support information retrieval (e.g., with BM25), you must **explicitly identify and preserve all named entities** from the input wherever possible. These may include applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, or any other specific proper nouns mentioned in the original propositions or their evidence.\n\nYou MAY:\n\n- **Edit** a proposition for clarity, precision, or brevity.\n- **Merge** propositions that convey the same meaning.\n- **Split** a proposition that contains multiple distinct claims.\n- **Add** a new proposition if a distinct idea is implied by the evidence but not yet stated.\n- **Remove** propositions that become redundant after merging or splitting.\n\nYou should **liberally add new propositions** when useful to express distinct ideas that are otherwise implicit or entangled in broader statements—but never preserve duplicates.\n\nWhen editing, **retain or introduce references to specific named entities** from the evidence wherever possible, as this improves clarity and retrieval fidelity.\n\nEdge cases to handle:\n\n- **Contradictions** – If two propositions conflict, keep the one with stronger supporting evidence, or merge them into a conditional statement. Lower the confidence score of weaker or uncertain claims.\n- **No supporting observations** – Keep the proposition, but retain its original confidence and decay unless justified by new evidence.\n- **Granularity mismatch** – If one proposition subsumes others, prefer the version that avoids redundancy while preserving all distinct ideas.\n- **Confidence and decay recalibration** – After editing, merging, or splitting, update the confidence and decay scores based on the final form of the proposition and evidence.\n\nGeneral guidelines:\n\n- Keep each proposition clear and concise (typically 1–2 sentences).\n- Maintain all meaningful content from the originals.\n- Provide a brief reasoning/evidence statement for each final proposition.\n- Confidence and decay scores range from 1–10 (higher = stronger or longer-lasting).\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you revise, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence in the proposition based on how directly and clearly it is supported by the evidence. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is the claim directly supported by clear, named interactions in the observations?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence closely tied to the proposition?\n- **Completeness**: Are key details present and unambiguous?\n- **Engagement Level**: Does the user interact meaningfully with the named content?\n\nScore: **1 (weak/assumed)** to **10 (explicitly demonstrated)**. High scores require direct and strong evidence from the observations.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the insight is likely to remain relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Immediacy**: Is the activity time-sensitive?\n- **Durability**: Will the proposition remain true over time?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-term relevance or behavioral pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nProposition 1: Andrew is testing or running commands related to the development process, possibly involving browser synchronization.\nReasoning: The terminal output shows a command being executed in PowerShell (`pwsh`) and mentions a task scheduled to run after 30 ms, followed by a browser sync reload. This suggests that Andrew is testing or running commands related to the development process.\nProposition 2: Andrew is currently focused on building the HTML structure of his website.\nReasoning: The user is actively working on the `index.html` file, adding and editing HTML markup.\nProposition 3: Andrew is actively working on styling the website using SCSS files.\nReasoning: The user is working on SCSS files such as `colors.scss`, `spacing.scss`, and `font-size.scss`, which contain CSS variables and styles.\nProposition 4: Andrew is working on a section of the website that includes a quote from Janice Hsu.\nReasoning: The design preview shows a section with a quote from Janice Hsu, indicating that Andrew is working on a section of the website that includes content and design elements.\nProposition 5: Andrew is currently engaged in front-end web development using Visual Studio Code.\nReasoning: The user is actively working within Visual Studio Code, as evidenced by the open files and the presence of a code editor interface. The user is specifically editing SCSS files, which indicates a focus on front-end development.\nProposition 6: Andrew is focused on refining the design of angled top and bottom elements in his project.\nReasoning: The user is frequently interacting with the `decoration.scss` file, modifying SCSS styles for angled top and bottom elements. This suggests a deep engagement with the project\'s design aspects.\nProposition 7: Andrew prefers to see the real-time preview of his website while developing.\nReasoning: The user is using a browser to view the live preview of the website, indicating a preference for real-time feedback on their work. This suggests a preference for immediate visual confirmation of changes.\nProposition 8: Andrew uses the terminal to manage tasks and automate processes during development.\nReasoning: The user is executing commands in the terminal, which implies they are managing tasks such as reloading the browser or running other development-related commands. This indicates a level of automation and familiarity with the development process.\nProposition 9: Andrew prefers to develop projects with responsive design principles.\nReasoning: The user is working on a project involving responsive design, as indicated by the use of `rem()` functions in the SCSS files. This suggests a preference for responsive design practices.\n\nSupporting observations:\n- ```markdown\n## Building the Website for My Course (Coding Timelapse)\n\n### File Explorer\n- `index.html`\n- `alternatingBlocks.scss`\n- `decorations.scss`\n\n### Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)\n```\n<!-- index.html -->\n<section class="fullwidthFeature">\n</section>\n\n<section class="alternatingBlocks">\n</section>\n\n<section class="quote">\n    <div class="container">\n        <!-- Content -->\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<main>\n</main>\n\n<footer>\n</footer>\n\n<!-- colors.scss -->\n@use \'functions\' as *;\n\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n\n<!-- spacing.scss -->\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n\n<!-- font-size.scss -->\n$font-size-xsm: 1rem;\n$font-size-sm: 1.125rem;\n$font-size-md: 1.25rem;\n$font-size-lg: 1.5rem;\n$font-size-xl: 2rem;\n\n<!-- flex.scss -->\n$flex-direction: row;\n$justify-content: center;\n$align-items: center;\n```\n\n### Terminal\n```\nDEBUG CONSOLE\nTERMINAL\n1: pwsh\n```\n\n### Browser Console\n```\nTask after 30 ms\nbrowserSyncReload...\nbrowserSyncReload after 1.04 ms\n```\n\n### Webpage Design\n- **Protected Payments**\n  - **Praesent a justo efficitur, tincidunt purus quis**\n  - Ut sapien lectus, vulputate vitae lacus vel, tincidunt sodales ipsum.
