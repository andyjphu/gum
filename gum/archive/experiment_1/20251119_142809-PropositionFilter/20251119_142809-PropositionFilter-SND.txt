[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You will label sets of propositions based on how similar they are to eachother.\n\n# Propositions\n\n[id=7] Andrew is actively working on styling the website using SCSS files.\n    Reasoning: The user is working on SCSS files such as `colors.scss`, `spacing.scss`, and `font-size.scss`, which contain CSS variables and styles.\n\n[id=6] Andrew is currently focused on building the HTML structure of his website.\n    Reasoning: The user is actively working on the `index.html` file, adding and editing HTML markup.\n\n[id=3] Andrew is testing or running commands related to the development process, possibly involving browser synchronization.\n    Reasoning: The terminal output shows a command being executed in PowerShell (`pwsh`) and mentions a task scheduled to run after 30 ms, followed by a browser sync reload. This suggests that Andrew is testing or running commands related to the development process.\n\n[id=8] Andrew is working on a section of the website that includes a quote from Janice Hsu.\n    Reasoning: The design preview shows a section with a quote from Janice Hsu, indicating that Andrew is working on a section of the website that includes content and design elements.\n\n[id=10] Andrew is currently engaged in front-end web development using Visual Studio Code.\n    Reasoning: The user is actively working within Visual Studio Code, as evidenced by the open files and the presence of a code editor interface. The user is specifically editing SCSS files, which indicates a focus on front-end development.\n\n[id=11] Andrew is focused on refining the design of angled top and bottom elements in his project.\n    Reasoning: The user is frequently interacting with the `decoration.scss` file, modifying SCSS styles for angled top and bottom elements. This suggests a deep engagement with the project\'s design aspects.\n\n[id=12] Andrew prefers to see the real-time preview of his website while developing.\n    Reasoning: The user is using a browser to view the live preview of the website, indicating a preference for real-time feedback on their work.
