[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant tasked with analyzing user behavior based on transcribed activity.\n\n# Analysis\n\nUsing a transcription of andrew\'s activity, analyze andrew\'s current activities, behavior, and preferences. Draw insightful, concrete conclusions.\n\nTo support effective information retrieval (e.g., using BM25), your analysis must **explicitly identify and refer to specific named entities** mentioned in the transcript. This includes applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, and any other proper nouns. Avoid general summaries—**use exact names** wherever possible, even if only briefly referenced.\n\nConsider these points in your analysis:\n\n- What specific tasks or goals is andrew actively working towards, as evidenced by named files, apps, platforms, or individuals?\n- What applications, documents, or content does andrew clearly prefer engaging with? Identify them by name.\n- What does andrew choose to ignore or deprioritize, and what might this imply about their focus or intentions?\n- What are the strengths or weaknesses in andrew’s behavior or tools? Cite relevant named entities or resources.\n\nProvide detailed, concrete explanations for each inference. **Support every claim with specific references to named entities in the transcript.**\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you generate, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence based on how clearly the evidence supports your claim. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is there direct interaction with a specific, named entity (e.g., opened “Notion,” responded to “Slack” from “Alex”)?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence clearly tied to the proposition?\n- **Engagement Level**: Was the interaction meaningful or sustained?\n\nScore: **1 (weak support)** to **10 (explicit, strong support)**. High scores require specific named references.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the proposition is likely to stay relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Urgency**: Does the task or interest have clear time pressure?\n- **Durability**: Will this matter 24 hours later or more?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-lasting insight or pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nBelow is a set of transcribed actions and interactions that andrew has performed:\n\n## User Activity Transcriptions\n\n[Manual] ```markdown\n# Visual Studio Code Screenshot Transcription\n\n## File Explorer\n- **OPEN EDITORS**\n  - GROUP 1\n    - index.html\n    - quote.scss\n    - decorations.scss\n  - GROUP 2\n    - colors.scss\n    - spacing.scss\n    - columns.scss\n    - font-size.scss\n- **RESPONSIVE-WEB-BEGINNERS**\n  - assets\n    - img\n      - asterisk-solid.svg\n      - bell-solid.svg\n      - comments-dollar-solid.svg\n      - janice-hsu.jpg\n      - laptop-check.svg\n      - laptop-dashboard.svg\n      - logo-mythos.svg\n      - quotation-mark.svg\n      - tablet-payments.svg\n      - tablet-phone.svg\n      - unicorn.svg\n\n## Editor Tabs\n- **quote.scss**\n  ```scss\n  @use \'../util\' as *;\n\n  .quote {\n    background-color: $darkPurple;\n    color: $white;\n\n    &__text {\n      position: relative;\n      font-size: clamp(rem(24), 4vw, rem(36));\n      line-height: 1.25;\n      font-weight: 700;\n      margin-bottom: $space-xlg;\n\n      &::before, &::after {\n        content: \'\';\n        position: absolute;\n        background: url(\'/assets/img/quotation-mark.svg\');\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- **colors.scss**\n  ```scss\n  margin-right: auto;\n  margin-left: auto;\n\n  &-8 {\n    @include breakpoint(large){\n      width: 66.667%;\n    }\n  }\n\n  &-10 {\n    @include breakpoint(large){\n      width: 83.333%;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Terminal\n```\n[21:04:41] Finished \'jsTask\' after 31 ms\n[21:04:41] Starting \'browserSyncReload\'...\n[21:04:41] Finished \'browserSyncReload\' after 642 µs\n[Browsersync] Reloading Browsers...\n```\n\n## Web Browser\n```\nlocalhost:3000\n```\n\n## Website Content\n**PROTECTED PAYMENTS**\n*Praesent a justo efficitur, tincidunt purus quis*\nUt sapien lectus, vulputate vitae lacus vel, tincidunt sodales ipsum.

The code snippet shows the structure of a container with a class `container`.\n- **Context**: The user is likely building a responsive website, as indicated by the title "Building the website for my course (coding timelapse)".\n- **Note**: The terminal at the bottom indicates that tasks like `browserSyncReload` have been executed, suggesting that the user is testing the changes in real-time.\n\n#### Image 2:\n- **Action**: The user continues to work on the SCSS file (`quote.scss`), specifically focusing on the `.angled-top` and `.angled-bottom` classes.\n- **Specific Action**: The user adds styles for positioning these elements relative and setting their background color to `$darkPurple`.\n- **Context**: The user is enhancing the design of the quote section, possibly adding decorative elements to improve visual appeal.\n- **Note**: The browser preview on the right side shows the current state of the website, which includes a blue background and a section with text and an image of a person.\n\n#### Image 3:\n- **Action**: The user is working on the SCSS file (`quote.scss`) and adding styles for the `.quote` class.\n- **Specific Action**: The user sets the background color to `$darkPurple`, the text color to white, and applies a font size using `clamp()` for better responsiveness.\n- **Context**: The user is ensuring that the text within the quote section looks good across different screen sizes.\n- **Note**: The terminal output confirms that tasks like `jsTask` and `browserSyncReload` have been completed successfully, indicating that the user is testing the changes in real-time.\n\n### Summary of Actions:\n1. **HTML Markup Addition**:\n   - Added HTML structure for a quote section in `index.html`.\n\n2. **SCSS Styling**:\n   - Added styles for `.angled-top` and `.angled-bottom` in `quote.scss`.\n   - Set background color and position for `.angled-top` and `.angled-bottom`.\n   - Applied styles for the `.quote` class in `quote.scss`, including background color, text color, and font size.\n\n3. **Responsive Design**:\n   - Ensured that the text within the quote section is responsive using `clamp()`.\n   - Tested the changes in real-time using `browserSyncReload`.\n\n4. **Real-Time Testing**:\n   - Used the terminal to execute tasks like `browserSyncReload` to see immediate changes in the browser preview.\n\n# Task\n\nGenerate **at least 5 distinct, well-supported propositions** about andrew, each grounded in the transcript. \n\nBe conservative in your confidence estimates. Just because an application appears on andrew\'s screen does not mean they have deeply engaged with it. They may have only glanced at it for a second, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. \n\nAssign high confidence scores (e.g., 8-10) only when the transcriptions provide explicit, direct evidence that andrew is actively engaging with the content in a meaningful way. Keep in mind that that the content on the screen is what the user is viewing. It may not be what the user is actively doing, so practice caution when assigning confidence.\n\nGenerate propositions across the scale to get a wide range of inferences about andrew.  \n\nReturn your results in this exact JSON format:\n\n{\n  "propositions": [\n    {\n      "proposition": "[Insert your proposition here]",\n      "reasoning": "[Provide detailed evidence from specific parts of the transcriptions to clearly justify this proposition. Refer explicitly to named entities where applicable.]",\n      "confidence": "[Confidence score (1–10)]",\n      "decay": "[Decay score (1–10)]"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}'}]
