[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant tasked with analyzing user behavior based on transcribed activity.\n\n# Analysis\n\nUsing a transcription of andrew\'s activity, analyze andrew\'s current activities, behavior, and preferences. Draw insightful, concrete conclusions.\n\nTo support effective information retrieval (e.g., using BM25), your analysis must **explicitly identify and refer to specific named entities** mentioned in the transcript. This includes applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, and any other proper nouns. Avoid general summaries—**use exact names** wherever possible, even if only briefly referenced.\n\nConsider these points in your analysis:\n\n- What specific tasks or goals is andrew actively working towards, as evidenced by named files, apps, platforms, or individuals?\n- What applications, documents, or content does andrew clearly prefer engaging with? Identify them by name.\n- What does andrew choose to ignore or deprioritize, and what might this imply about their focus or intentions?\n- What are the strengths or weaknesses in andrew’s behavior or tools? Cite relevant named entities or resources.\n\nProvide detailed, concrete explanations for each inference. **Support every claim with specific references to named entities in the transcript.**\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you generate, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence based on how clearly the evidence supports your claim. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is there direct interaction with a specific, named entity (e.g., opened “Notion,” responded to “Slack” from “Alex”)?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence clearly tied to the proposition?\n- **Engagement Level**: Was the interaction meaningful or sustained?\n\nScore: **1 (weak support)** to **10 (explicit, strong support)**. High scores require specific named references.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the proposition is likely to stay relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Urgency**: Does the task or interest have clear time pressure?\n- **Durability**: Will this matter 24 hours later or more?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-lasting insight or pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nBelow is a set of transcribed actions and interactions that andrew has performed:\n\n## User Activity Transcriptions\n\n[Manual] ```markdown\n# Visual Studio Code Screenshot Transcription\n\n## File Explorer\n- `index.html`\n- `quote.scss`\n- `decorations.scss`\n- `hero.scss`\n\n## Decorations.scss File Content\n```scss\n@use \'../util\' as *;\n\n* > .angled-top, * > .angled-bottom {\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n* > .angled-top, * > .angled-bottom {\n    position: relative;\n}\n\n.angled-top::before, .angled-bottom::after {\n    content: \'\';\n    position: absolute;\n    background: $darkPurple;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\n.angled-top {\n    &::before {\n        top: 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Colors.scss File Content\n```scss\n@use \'functions\' as *;\n\n$space-xsm: rem(10);\n$space-sm: rem(16);\n$space-md: rem(20);\n$space-lg: rem(30);\n$space-xl: rem(40);\n```\n\n## Terminal Output\n```\nTask \'after 22 ms\nbrowserSyncReload\'...\nbrowserSyncReload\' after 492 µs\nBrowsers...\n```\n\n## Web Browser\n- `localhost:3000`\n- `Mythos`\n\n## Website Content\n- **PROTECTED PAYMENTS**\n  - **Praesent a justo efficitur, tincidunt purus quis**\n  - Ut sapien lectus, vulputate vitae lacus vel, tincidunt sodales ipsum.

Just because an application appears on andrew\'s screen does not mean they have deeply engaged with it. They may have only glanced at it for a second, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. \n\nAssign high confidence scores (e.g., 8-10) only when the transcriptions provide explicit, direct evidence that andrew is actively engaging with the content in a meaningful way. Keep in mind that that the content on the screen is what the user is viewing. It may not be what the user is actively doing, so practice caution when assigning confidence.\n\nGenerate propositions across the scale to get a wide range of inferences about andrew.  \n\nReturn your results in this exact JSON format:\n\n{\n  "propositions": [\n    {\n      "proposition": "[Insert your proposition here]",\n      "reasoning": "[Provide detailed evidence from specific parts of the transcriptions to clearly justify this proposition.
