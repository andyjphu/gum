[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are an expert analyst. A cluster of similar propositions are shown below, followed by their supporting observations.\n\nYour job is to produce a **final set** of propositions that is clear, non-redundant, and captures everything about the user, {user_name}.\n\nTo support information retrieval (e.g., with BM25), you must **explicitly identify and preserve all named entities** from the input wherever possible. These may include applications, websites, documents, people, organizations, tools, or any other specific proper nouns mentioned in the original propositions or their evidence.\n\nYou MAY:\n\n- **Edit** a proposition for clarity, precision, or brevity.\n- **Merge** propositions that convey the same meaning.\n- **Split** a proposition that contains multiple distinct claims.\n- **Add** a new proposition if a distinct idea is implied by the evidence but not yet stated.\n- **Remove** propositions that become redundant after merging or splitting.\n\nYou should **liberally add new propositions** when useful to express distinct ideas that are otherwise implicit or entangled in broader statements—but never preserve duplicates.\n\nWhen editing, **retain or introduce references to specific named entities** from the evidence wherever possible, as this improves clarity and retrieval fidelity.\n\nEdge cases to handle:\n\n- **Contradictions** – If two propositions conflict, keep the one with stronger supporting evidence, or merge them into a conditional statement. Lower the confidence score of weaker or uncertain claims.\n- **No supporting observations** – Keep the proposition, but retain its original confidence and decay unless justified by new evidence.\n- **Granularity mismatch** – If one proposition subsumes others, prefer the version that avoids redundancy while preserving all distinct ideas.\n- **Confidence and decay recalibration** – After editing, merging, or splitting, update the confidence and decay scores based on the final form of the proposition and evidence.\n\nGeneral guidelines:\n\n- Keep each proposition clear and concise (typically 1–2 sentences).\n- Maintain all meaningful content from the originals.\n- Provide a brief reasoning/evidence statement for each final proposition.\n- Confidence and decay scores range from 1–10 (higher = stronger or longer-lasting).\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nFor each proposition you revise, evaluate its strength using two scales:\n\n### 1. Confidence Scale\n\nRate your confidence in the proposition based on how directly and clearly it is supported by the evidence. Consider:\n\n- **Direct Evidence**: Is the claim directly supported by clear, named interactions in the observations?\n- **Relevance**: Is the evidence closely tied to the proposition?\n- **Completeness**: Are key details present and unambiguous?\n- **Engagement Level**: Does the user interact meaningfully with the named content?\n\nScore: **1 (weak/assumed)** to **10 (explicitly demonstrated)**. High scores require direct and strong evidence from the observations.\n\n### 2. Decay Scale\n\nRate how long the insight is likely to remain relevant. Consider:\n\n- **Immediacy**: Is the activity time-sensitive?\n- **Durability**: Will the proposition remain true over time?\n\nScore: **1 (short-lived)** to **10 (long-term relevance or behavioral pattern)**.\n\n# Input\n\nProposition 1: Andrew is currently focused on styling a `.quote` class in his SCSS file (`quote.scss`).\nReasoning: The user is currently focused on styling a `.quote` class in their SCSS file (`quote.scss`), as indicated by the specific SCSS code snippet.\nProposition 2: Andrew is using Visual Studio Code for front-end web development.\nReasoning: The user is using Visual Studio Code for front-end web development, as evidenced by the file explorer and code editor screenshots.\nProposition 3: Andrew is working on a multi-file project related to a responsive web design course.\nReasoning: The user is working on a multi-file project related to a responsive web design course, as indicated by the course title and the use of multiple SCSS files.\nProposition 4: Andrew is managing tasks and automating processes during development using the terminal.\nReasoning: The user is managing tasks and automating processes during development using the terminal, as indicated by the execution of commands like `browserSyncReload`.\nProposition 5: Andrew is focused on styling the quote section of his website using SCSS.\nReasoning: Andrew is actively working on styling specific sections of his website, particularly the quote section, as evidenced by the frequent opening and editing of the `quote.scss` and `decoration.scss` files. The detailed CSS properties being added suggest a deep engagement with the styling process.\nProposition 6: Andrew is using a video player to follow a tutorial or watch a recording related to web development.\nReasoning: The presence of the video player indicates that Andrew is likely following a tutorial or watching a recording while working on his project. This suggests he is learning or seeking guidance on web development techniques.\nProposition 7: Andrew is systematically applying CSS properties to different sections of his website using SCSS.\nReasoning: Andrew is frequently switching between different SCSS files (`quote.scss`, `decoration.scss`) to apply various CSS properties. This indicates a systematic approach to styling different elements of the website.\nProposition 8: Andrew prefers using Visual Studio Code for web development tasks.\nReasoning: The user is consistently working within the Visual Studio Code environment, which suggests a preference for this integrated development environment (IDE) over others. This implies that Andrew finds Visual Studio Code efficient for his web development tasks.\nProposition 9: Andrew uses browser developer tools to inspect and refine the layout and appearance of his website.\nReasoning: The user is frequently checking the browser developer tools to inspect the website\'s layout and appearance. This suggests that Andrew values real-time feedback on how his changes impact the final output.\nProposition 10: Andrew is following a tutorial or guide to add HTML markup to the website.\nReasoning: The video player shows a title \'Adding the HTML markup,\' suggesting that Andrew is following a tutorial or guide to add HTML markup to the website.\nProposition 11: Andrew is testing or running commands related to the development process, possibly involving browser synchronization.\nReasoning: The user is actively working on the `index.html` file, adding and editing HTML markup, and the terminal shows a command being executed in PowerShell, suggesting testing or running development-related commands.\nProposition 12: Andrew is currently focused on building the HTML structure of his website.\nReasoning: The user is actively working on the `index.html` file, adding and editing HTML markup, and the terminal shows a command being executed in PowerShell, suggesting testing or running development-related commands.\nProposition 13: Andrew is using SCSS for styling.\nReasoning: The user is using SCSS for styling, as evidenced by the presence of SCSS files and the use of utility functions like `rem()`.\nProposition 14: Andrew is testing changes in real-time using `browserSyncReload`.\nReasoning: The user is testing changes in real-time using `browserSyncReload`, as indicated by the terminal output.\nProposition 15: Andrew is refining the design of angled top and bottom elements.\nReasoning: The user is focused on refining the design of angled top and bottom elements, as seen in the `decoration.scss` file.\n\nSupporting observations:\n- ```markdown\n# Visual Studio Code Screenshot Transcription\n\n## File Explorer\n- `index.html`\n- `quote.scss`\n-
